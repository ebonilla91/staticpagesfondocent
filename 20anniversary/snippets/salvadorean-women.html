That same year, Joshi Levan, whom we interviewed for this article, left Nicaragua to live in El Salvador. In 2013, she joined Ameyalli as part of the batucada. She began her organizing experience by making posters, stickers, and other activism materials that inspired her to pursue a career in communications. Joshi is now thirty-one years old; she is a public relations officer; and she is part of Ameyalli’s Board of Directors, where she accompanies and advises the younger activists who lead the organization.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Could you tell us about the origins of Ameyalli?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">When I joined the collective, Ameyalli had been around for six years. From what I understand, it arose from the need to transform the reality that impacts women since they are girls, adolescents, and young adults. It also emerged because of a schism with adult women who didn’t allow [younger women] to make changes. For this reason, one of their first identities was the Women’s Collective to Transform Santo Tomás. Following the schism, they sought to generate real spaces for political participation for young people in the municipality.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">In those years, Santo Tomás was in a very interesting political moment, which is unfortunately no longer the case. Before, one could talk to the authorities, and there was a commitment to generate a municipal youth policy, center intergenerational issues, and consider how they intersect with feminism—so there was an acknowledgement that patriarchy exists. In addition, [there was a desire to understand the gaps between teenage girls, young women, and adult women so they could organize accordingly. First they met at a park; then they began meeting at a compañera’s house—as it happens, several of the collective’s founders were sisters. In 2013 I joined, and I liked it because it was the most formidable collective when it came to occupying the public space and creating alliances and coalitions. They had a very powerful voice setting the agenda, and they still do. Witnessing such empowered young women express themselves in that manner had a deep impact in me. That’s why I decided to approach them and become a member.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Who does Ameyalli work with and how do they do it? Could you mention some examples of initiatives, activities, or processes you all have developed?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We work with women of all ages. At first, we only worked with young women, but now we work with children and teenagers, young women and adult women. As regards adult women, we work very closely and in coordination with the Santo Tomás Women’s Movement, whose focus is agroecological orchards, environmental justice, and food sovereignty.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We work with children to create psychosocial support processes. Within the framework of the pandemic, for example, we co-created an initiative to combat the overcrowding to which children were exposed. We delivered kits so that children could stay at home. We also developed training spaces to teach them to recognize their emotions and thus be able to identify, name, and understand them.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We also work with young women on the identification, acknowledgement, and defense of sexual and reproductive rights, particularly abortion. In 2015, we established the Cuerpos Libres project, which is a festival; we’ll be celebrating its eighth edition soon. In recent years we have focused on training young artists, so we’ve created a platform for teenage and young women that encompasses three areas: singing, audiovisual works, and muralism. Before carrying out activities that involve the public, they learn about sexual and reproductive rights.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Preventing violence and caring for survivors is a transversal topic for the association. We provide psychological accompaniment and accompany survivors if they decide to report what’s happening to them to the authorities. If we don’t have  enough capacity to support survivors, we refer them to other organizations that provide psychological and legal accompaniment.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Could you tell me about how you have evolved, changed, and become resilient as a part of the association? Is there a before and after in the work you do?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We’ve had several crucial moments that have guided our transformation. The first one was the generational debate after our membership grew in age, and one of the questions we asked ourselves was are we going to expand the age range of participation or are we going to stick to what we proposed initially? The collective response was that we could welcome people regardless of age, but leadership roles would remain in the hands of women under thirty.<br>We, the older ones, have taken a step back. Representation in public spaces and day-to-day decision-making is in the hands of young women leaders. The rest of us work in other fields; we help making connections; we share experiences and knowledge within collective spaces; and in that way we contribute to the sustainability of the project or of Ameyalli as such.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Another milestone was 2015. In that year, Ameyalli changed in many ways; our identity changed as we acquired our legal status and went from being a collective to being an association because we needed more robust legal protections. This was also the year when we ventured into environmental and territorial defense. And it wasn’t as if we went and began defending another territory; we were literally defending our home. This made an impact on us and led us to evolve in the way we identified the types of the violence that we, as women defenders, experience.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We also began to acknowledge the importance of self-care, [which is particularly relevant] because our activism had been very much influenced by the post-war period and its philosophy of fighting, risking one’s body: winning or dying if it’s the last thing you do. That’s how we did it the first few years, and it had serious consequences for some compañeras.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">This allowed us to recognize that if we didn’t pay attention to this, it would come back to harm us; that is, it would cause the deterioration of our mental health, and so we acknowledged mental health as a fundamental pillar of self-care. In order to do that, we had to deconstruct what we understood as self-care, but now we understand that self-care is much more than simply having free time: it’s having resources so the people who make up the organization can have mental health care if they need it, especially now with the pandemic; it has become a necessity.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">What has it meant to you as a young woman to be a part of your organization and to do the work that you do?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">It changed my life. That’s why I said at the beginning that Ameyalli was about transformation, and indeed something that any member or former member can tell you is that it changes lives—and I think that’s a crucially important fact for all of us. For me, in particular, it allowed me to acknowledge myself as a lesbian and as a Black woman in a country where we are totally erased, but also to see myself beyond gender, sexual orientation, and identity—so it did; it did change my life.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">If Ameyalli hadn’t crossed my path, my life would be different. I wouldn’t be doing this interview; I wouldn’t have been able to study something that I am passionate about; I wouldn’t be able to collaborate with spaces that have nurtured me, to have plans to continue doing this, and to continue contributing to a more just society. I think [Ameyalli] has allowed me to grow as a person, professionally and emotionally; it has allowed me to deepen my knowledge around mental health, self-esteem, and pain, as well as the need to heal as I come to terms with my history, my ancestral identity.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">So, yes, it has changed me in many ways. It has allowed me to see and recognize myself, grow, be in constant transformation… because we aren’t static beings; we evolve through our experiences, the relationships we build, and memories we treasure.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">What does Ameyalli represent for the girls, adolescents, and women with whom you work? What would happen if your organization disappeared?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">I think it represents rebellion and stubbornness, like the izote, which is a flower that grows in inhospitable environments and survives despite adversity. Ameyalli represents stubbornness and resilience. Here, women, like me, can discover that there are new ways of living their lives, that there is another reality they can experience and transform, that what they have been taught isn’t necessarily right, and that things that happen to them and the things they sometimes feel have an explanation. Patriarchy and capitalism impact their bodies. It isn’t that they aren’t trying hard enough; it’s a whole system that sustains this, and it permeates our bodies and our lives. Women have said it in their own words: “They’ve helped me so much in building my garden and making me understand that I’m important.” I’ll summarize it by saying that another life is possible, and it should be within our reach, all of us.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Now that Ameyalli is working more closely with groups than institutions, due to the Salvadoran context, we have been able to notice these more significant changes. There’s this lady, for example, who’s had a great impact on me because when we met her she was totally different. But now she is there on all the processes, and she is incredibly active. Everyone talks about her: Little Rosita here, Little Rosita there, everyone knows Little Rosita. She is a woman of about seventy years of age, and when she participated in a process with transwomen, they said, “she is the grandmother I never had.” And that’s shocking because she is a person who was involved in the church and conservative issues, but now she has truly opened herself up and sees us as her partners and an organization that is there to support her; plus, she recognizes our diversity.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">A similar example is that of our colleague who now coordinates the environmental justice area. She came to us when she participated in one of our training processes, and now she coordinates the area. She’s involved with other areas such as nutrition advice, the alliance, and water privatization. And being there will change you; it changes your life. You don’t necessarily have to be part of the process, but somehow we sow a little seed… And if Ameyalli ceases to exist, I am sure we’ll have planted those seeds, and they will sprout because they didn’t fall on arid land; they fell on fertile soil. And I know the women, the young women, the teenagers, and even the girls and boys [we have worked with] will continue that legacy, perhaps in a different place, in a different way. In the end, that legacy is about helping others believe in the premise of a more just and equal world for women, free of violence and discrimination and in harmony with nature.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Could you share with us the memory of a challenging situation that you have faced as an organization and how you overcame it?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">There have been many, including violent incidents with our compañeras, but one of the most challenging was the kidnapping of a compañera. That was a challenging year, and it reminded us that although we offer accompaniment, we also need to be accompanied ourselves. And that’s how it goes; it goes both ways because we inhabit this system, so it was only a matter of time before something happened to us, and when it did, it was incredibly hard. I remember making the missing poster and uploading it to social media. It was incredibly hard and traumatic, especially at that time when so many people had gone missing in El Salvador.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">To close, could you share with us an inspiring or significant experience related to the work you do?</h2><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">An inspiring moment was when we won the Sierra Verde case. Sonia Sánchez is the mother of four Ameyalli compañeras; her daughters are founders. She was sued—in fact, one of her daughters was also named in the suit—by a construction company which has it out for environmental defenders. [They sued and] one of defenders settled out of court, but our compañeras’ mother didn’t want to settle. They made it through the first lawsuit unscathed, but then the company sued her, specifically, for defamation. They were suing Sonia for 25,000 USD, and they wanted her to donate that amount to a pro-life organization.</p><p style="padding-top:11px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Those were hard days, and we had to organize a lot. I remember that in Ameyalli we bought a lot of t-shirts, and we brought markers and stuff to write on the t-shirts outside of the courthouse. We also had the batucada ready, so it was pretty impressive when Sonia won. We all hugged each other: an environmental defender had defeated a mega company that is everywhere in Central America. Sonia beating them was such a huge victory. That taught us that no matter how rough and difficult the road ahead is, those moments prove how valuable the strength and stubbornness of women are.

We’ll keep the faith as long as our cause is just.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="animation-container" style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); opacity: 1; left: 261px; top: 6487.8px; width: 95px; height: 25px; z-index: 319;"><style class="">@keyframes animation_2_1 {
