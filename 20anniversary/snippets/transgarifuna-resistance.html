It is from that standpoint that they fight for their rights and lives.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">To learn more about the collective’s work, we spoke to one of its founders, Obrayan Robinson, a young artivist and defender of his country’s trans and black population. Originally from La Ceiba, Obrayan migrated to Tegucigalpa ten years ago in search of economic opportunities but, above all, to be able to live freely as himself.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Obrayan has a teaching degree in plastic arts. Despite this, he thinks that as an openly trans person he would have never been given the chance to teach, so, as a Negrititudes member, he has made his abilities available to others, exchanging his artistic knowledge with other community members who have trained in different fields, but who, like him, are passionate about creating collectively.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">How did Negrititudes Trans emerge? What was the context? What was happening with trans men, non-binary folks, and LBTQI+ groups in your community or country at that time?</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Negrititudes was born to address the concerns of a small group of trans and non-binary youth who were in different locations and began to connect through social media to talk about our experiences: family issues, employability and the violence that we are subjected to in different environments. It was precisely that year that several violent acts against the LGBTQI+ community took place, and we were afraid since we were out; we didn’t know what could happen to us. Despite this, we always joined some actions by LGBTQI+ groups; however, we soon realized matters of race were not being acknowledged even by sexual diversity groups. That’s when we began naming this other reality that intersects with our identity, and we thought we needed to bring it to the fore, even if it provoked annoyance and discomfort.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">In our meetings, we reflected with colleagues, [and we concluded that] although we are trans and non-binary people, skin color is still an issue that intersects with our identity. It’s the first thing people notice, and the way they treat us and behave toward us is influenced by it. It was then that we began to delve into these issues from a different perspective. We considered racist violence and the struggle and resistance of black and Garífuna peoples in Honduras. We want to reconnect with our history: Why did we live in the cities? Why did my grandparents have to migrate to these cities? It’s because they sold us the idea that there are no opportunities in our territories; there is no [economic] development in our communities.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We recognized how structural racism has taken away our identity and our history. So, for us, 2019 was filled with revelations. We analyzed what was happening in the Garífuna communities and the violence experienced by the LGBTQI+ communities in the city. It was a lot. So, we said to ourselves: Let's get together and start a dialogue at least; it was all we could do at that point in time, but that dialogue was the seed the enabled us to later accompany actions in the Garífuna communities and in the LGBTIQ+ community. As a collective, we decided to work from an intersectional perspective that accounted for our gender identity, our sexuality, and our race. Above all, we committed to a more historical, anti-racist, and decolonial perspective, since it’s clear to us that our struggle is also connected to the recovery of our historical memory.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">What populations has Negrititudes Trans worked with and how do you go about it? Share with us some examples of initiatives, activities and processes developed.</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">When we started, we tried to organize as transmen; this is how Negrititudes Trans emerged. And we thought our work would be informed by our trans-masculinities, but it was very difficult to strengthen that organizational fabric, so we involved others: trans, non-binary, lesbian, bisexual, and mainly Garífuna people. Because the interaction between these groups can easily spark processes to reconnect with one’s identity and sexuality.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Over the last few years, we have worked on further building our capacities as well as the issue of visibility and communication strategies with an anti-racist perspective. By means of these strategies, we try to develop different actions, campaigns, or processes that allow us to explore our struggles and who we are. Another part of our journey has to do with art, which we see as crucial for the reconstruction of black and Garífuna peoples’ historical memory. Different artistic actions and expressions have allowed us to highlight what we do, to publicize our realities, our context, and what we’re fighting against. Then there is also the Trans Residence, which has primarily served as a safe space for us as a team, but which has allowed us to accompany other compañeres who have experienced instances of violence, marginalization, and impoverishment. When they needed support, the Residence became a space to embrace them.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Is there a before and after in the work your group does? Tell us about experiences that have triggered evolution, changes, and resilience.</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">It has not been easy. Of course, we have been improving and strengthening ourselves as a collective, but many of our founding members are gone. Some have decided to migrate because of the lack of opportunities here, and that has been difficult for us. Even so, we’ve persevered, and these situations have strengthened our belief in ourselves and what we do. Our work has enabled us to struggle on.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">I am one of the collective’s co-founders, and I have tried to accompany others who have gone through different experiences. This has also allowed me to devise strategies and tools to do the work in the best way possible. That’s the reason we believe organizational strengthening to be vital, and we acknowledge the external people and allied organizations that have been here with us, embracing us and generating opportunities for us to continue doing our work.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Nowadays, the collective can afford to pay the team of people that do the work; that was not the case last year. For the first three years, we were basically doing volunteer work, which was taxing and exhausting, especially for colleagues who were worse off than me and had to leave the space and the project in search of opportunities. So, it generates a lot of calm to know that now we have a team that has that opportunity and that this is allowing us to improve the quality of life of trans-racialized people a little. We are aware though, that the situation continues to be difficult, because in addition to financial concerns, there are colleagues who also carry the burden of violence and insecurity—they could be here today, but they could be gone tomorrow. That’s very painful.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">What does Negrititudes represent for the people you work with? What would happen if your organization disappeared?</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">There is something that has been deeply moving for me, and that is knowing that there are compañeres who have said they owe who they are today to this space, that is, “I am a trans person, and I acknowledge who I am through this name because that is who I was treated as when I came into this space.” That is very beautiful for us. We are keenly aware that our identities and our names are disregarded in other spaces, including our homes. As a collective, it is extremely gratifying to know that a trans person can come here and say their name is this or that and that they will be treated accordingly. That person always feels very happy because they know there’s a place where they are respected. For some, these are things that may be insignificant, but we know how important it is to have someone who recognizes who we are, respects us, embraces us, and involves us in collective actions</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">I think we have managed to carve a space ourselves and become a role model on issues of sexuality and race. Before us, there was no other organizational space that foregrounded our identity and sexuality or delved into the issue of racism. So, for the populations with whom we work, that is important.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">As a collective we have broken ground on several spheres, and this has been recognized by the very people with whom we’ve been involved. They make sure we know, and that fills us with gratitude and great joy, especially because we know that what we are doing is necessary, which encourages us to carry on. But if the time comes when Negrititudes Trans no longer exists, we hope other collectives will emerge, and we hope they continue to do the kind of work and improve upon it. We’ve really given it our best shot. Not only do we invest in strengthening the organization, we encourage every person who has ever been part of this collective to begin to develop processes of community building, collective building, and to put their own twist on them. This is already a small seed, our small contribution.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Can you share with us a challenging situation that you have faced as a group and how you overcame it?</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">There have been several. For example, for us as trans people, not having employment opportunities or access to resources that allow us to exist makes activism and sustaining an organization very difficult. [Activism and organizing] also imply resourcing our actions, and [these barriers hinder] not only our team, but also the same population with whom we work. Garífuna people are invited to our activities, but sometimes they can’t come because someone calls them to go clean their house, and they are obviously going choose cleaning that house over coming to a workshop. This evidently represents a challenge when we organize activities. We make arrangements for fifteen or twenty people, but when the time comes, you get eight participants, perhaps less. And those that manage to come sometimes have to leave early because they have to work or because they don’t want people to know they came. All this makes our work be harder.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">Before,  we used to have great expectations, but we have our feet on the ground now, and we’ve realized that the challenge here is not only to make the workshops as dynamic as possible: We must be aware and learn more about people’s day-to-day lives, what they’re going through, and based on that, we must come up with alternative so we can reach them, perhaps through the few people who manage to come [to the workshops]. We converse with them and engage them in our actions; we generate opportunities that allow them to get some resources. As I mentioned before, tomorrow they might decide to migrate, but that’s precisely where there is a need to create employment opportunities for transpeople, even if they have little training because they can strengthen their skills and knowledge on the job.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">Can you share with us an inspiring or significant experience from your work?</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">One of the most recent ones happened during the presentation of our documentary Awanda. For us, it was an amazing experience because the compañeres who participated in this documentary sat in front of an audience and got to share and talk about their lives, their resilience, and their rebellion against a cis, heteronormative system. For us, there is immense value in acknowledging their struggles and have them speak with their own voice. We don't want others to speak for us, we speak for ourselves. [This experience] was great because we never have spaces where we hold the mic and are able to speak to other people about the systems that affect us and how that makes us feel. That’s what we are looking for: We want to strengthen and promote that kind of participation and leadership, and that’s what we’re doing.</p><h2 style="padding-top:20px;font-family:spkv;font-weight:900;font-size:21px" class="view-mode unstyled style-2d17cb70-7bb7-47da-b13e-3e2526f0fea4">What do you, as an organization, envision for the future?</h2><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">As a collective, we are committed to achieving many transformations. One such transformation is the clear and full exercise of transpeople’s rights. We trust and try to believe that, at some point, our rights will be recognized. This will make our voices more audible and allow us greater participation so we can contribute to building a more just society for everyone. That is what we are committed to.</p><p style="padding-top:10px;font-family:Inclusive Sans;font-weight:400;font-size:15px" class="view-mode unstyled style-7be1d520-567e-45b1-b3ea-617371575195">We want our identities to be acknowledged by a society that respects our existence, which will reduce the degree of violence experienced by trans and non-binary people. We dream of more inclusive democracies that respect diversity and in which we lead small processes—and why not?—bigger processes that bring about positive changes for transpeople in our territories. That way, we won’t have to migrate, and if we [go somewhere else], it will be on holiday and not because we’re escaping the violence in our country.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="animation-container" style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); opacity: 1; left: 261px; top: 6109.73px; width: 95px; height: 25px; z-index: 317;"><style class="">@keyframes animation_2_1 {
